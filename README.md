# Working-With-CNNs-And-RNNs

This project was created for the course Deep Learning for Science (YMX8170).

The first task involves the use of different CNN models to classify chest x-ray images for pneumonia.

The second task involces using RNN models for predicting the oil temperature in an electricity transformer dataset.
